  This is pretty gross JP 29/3/16
  Basically we don't want to remove the `margin-top: 1.3rem` from the `.{primary/secondary/tertiary}-collection`'s
  because this will cause A LOT of vertical spacing issues.
  We also need the favourite collection to sit seamlessly against the primary collection when visible
  as such, when visible, this negative margin will negate the margin-top styles applied to `.primary-collection`
  but leave the spacing alone for the rest of the menu states

  TO BE CLEAR:
  This is a hack and a consequence of adding the favourite collection into the menu sections
  as an after thought and not as part of the design. Please ensure you consider this when you find this code.
  Don't give me a hard time, I know its shit. Thanks. JP.
