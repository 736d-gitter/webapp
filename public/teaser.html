hello. 

goeiedag. hola. osiyo. tere. yadra. salut. hallo. shalom. namaste. ciao. hei. buenos dÃ­as. sawatdii khrap. sawubona.




we're a little london-based bootstrapped startup. 

yes, another one. what makes us different? 

well, we've got a little experience behind us. 
we're not doing curated consumer social mobile location services. 
we're not based in shoreditch. 

the rest is pretty similar. say no to the corporate overlords. have fun using the most cutting edge technology. receive pay in peppercorns and stock.



if you fancy helping out, drop us an email and we'll let you know a little more. we're looking for someone to hack bad ass back-endy code, some HTML/CSS ninja and a designer who doesn't just make stuff pretty, but makes stuff simple.
