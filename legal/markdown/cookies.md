We use cookies and similar tools on our Gitter platform (“Gitter”) to improve its performance and enhance your user experience. This policy explains how we do that.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website, or another website, to recognise your device the next time you visit.  We use the term “cookies” in this policy to refer to all files that collect information in this way.

There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyse how well Gitter is performing, or even allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.

Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies will not collect information that identifies you, but will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use Gitter.

## What sort of cookies does Gitter use?

Generally, our cookies perform up to two different functions:

### 1. Essential cookies

Some cookies are essential for the operation of Gitter. If you opt to disable these cookies, you will not be able to access or use all of the features that Gitter incorporates.

### 2. Performance Cookies

We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors use Gitter and to monitor performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages.

### Does anyone else use cookies on Gitter?

We do use or allow third parties to serve cookies that fall into the two categories above. For example, like many companies, we may place cookies to help us monitor our traffic. We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, revenue tracking, improving site functionality and monitoring compliance with our terms and conditions and policies.

We currently allow Mixpanel and Google to place cookies on Gitter. We reserve the right to add additional cookies at any point in the future.  

### Can you block cookies?

As we have explained above, cookies help you to get the most out of Gitter.

However, if you do wish to disable cookies then you can do so by amending the settings within your browser or mobile device[, or by using this link [We recommend a link which disables the non-essential cookies]]

Please remember that if you do choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections of Gitter do not work properly.
