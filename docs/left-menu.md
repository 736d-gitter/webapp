# Dark arts of the left menu

The left menu lists all of your conversations. It also contains a few cunningly awesome features.

Firstly, understanding how the left menu is ordered is important. Any chat rooms or people that have been **favourited** will show first, followed by chat rooms where there are **unread notifications** and finally other chat rooms ordered by the time you last accessed them.

So that's basically:

 - Favourites
 - Unread notifications
 - Recents


If you click and drag any room below **favourites**, you can move it up into the favourites list. You can also explicitly order favourites by dragging them around.

Items below the favourites cannot be ordered as they are ordered by unread or recent activity.

You can also drag a room out of favourites. This will remove it from your favourites and it will automatically be positioned in the list below based on when it was last accessed as per all of the other recent rooms.


## Hiding rooms

It is also possible to hide a room from this list. If you receive a notification for the room again, it will reappear. If you no longer wish to receive notifications from that room, you should either leave that room (`/leave` slash command) or change notifications to mentions only. You cannot hide a one to one room.
