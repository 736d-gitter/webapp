Please symlink pre-commit to .git/hooks/pre-commit to enable the pre-commit hooks.

Prerequisites
-------------
* node.js 0.10+ `brew install node`
* [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
* [Kitematic](https://kitematic.com/) or `boot2docker` if you prefer
*

Getting Started
---------------
1. Open kitematic or setup a boot2docker instance called `dev`.
2. In Kitematic, choose "Install Docker Commands" from the application menu.
2. run `eval "$(docker-machine env dev)"` or, better yet, add it to your bash profile.
3. run `docker-compose up -d`
4. `npm install`
5. `npm install -g gulp`
6. `gulp css` (compiles css)
7. `npm install -g nodemon`
8. `nodemon` (this will run node and restart when anything changes based on config in nodemon.json)

Data Upgrades
-------------
`./scripts/upgrade-data.sh` will run through the contents of scripts/dataupgrades and are ment to update mongo's contents idempotently (running the script multiple times will have no effect).

This is run as part of the beta build, but is **not** run as part of a production build. The *individual* upgrade script must be run manually.

* dev: run `./scripts/upgrade-data.sh` yourself
* beta: updated automatically as part of the make task
* prod: run the individual script yourself. e.g `./scripts/dataupgrades/001-oauth-client/002-add-redirect-uri.sh mongo-replica-member-003/gitter`

Run Like Production
-------------------
1.  `make grunt`
2.  `node web --web:staticContent=public-processed/ --web:minified=true`

Upgrading gitter-services to add support for more services
----------------------------------------------------------
Recently merged a pull request for [gitter-services](https://github.com/gitterHQ/services)? then read onâ€¦

### Prerequisites
Before you proceed, make sure you have done the following:
1. pushed a tagged release of gitter-services to github
2. updated the gitter-services dependency in [webhookshandler](https://bitbucket.org/troupe/webhookshandler) via npm
3. deployed the new webhookshandler (dont worry, your new service wont be accessible unless someone is adept at guessing urls)

### Updating gitter-services
Once you are sure the above is done, preform the following:
1. update the version of the `gitter-services` dependency in package.json (dont forget about npm-shrinkwrap)
2. `npm install`
3. `make sprites`
4. commit your changes and release!

## Setting up ElasticSearch

1. Install ElasticSearch 1.2.2
  1. `cd $(brew --prefix)`
  2. `git checkout afe0820 /usr/local/Library/Formula/elasticsearch.rb` - version 1.3.4
  3. `brew install elasticsearch`  (remember to brew unlink elasticsearch if you've already got another version installed)

2. You might need to install [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

3. Ensure that your ansible repo is up-to-date: git@github.com:troupe/ansible.git

4. In the ansible project, change directory to `roles/elasticsearch/files/elastic-config`

5. Run `./XX-setup-plugins`

5. Start elasticsearch from the root of gitter-webapp: `./start-elasticsearch.sh`

6. Setup the mappings: `./01-create-index-with-mapping` (make sure your gitter-webapp is running before doing this...)

7. Setup the rivers: `./02-create-rivers`

8. Setup the alias: `./03-setup-alias`

9. Watch the elasticsearch logs for success, something like:

```

10. Log into HQ: http://localhost:9200/_plugin/HQ -> Connect


11. Check that there are lots of documents under the Gitter index.


## Updating the Social Graph

The social graph updater runs as a batch job in a cron every few hours. You can manually invoke it as follows.

```shell
NODE_ENV=beta node scripts/graphs/upload-graph.js
```

The uploader script starts a local webserver, and it will guess the URL for that webserver by looking at the host computers
network interfaces. If you want to the script against production from your developer computer, you'll need to specify the OpenVPN
tunnel interface, otherwise the script will serve from a URL inaccessible from OpenVPN.

You can do this as follows:
```shell
NODE_ENV=prod LISTEN_IF=utun0 node scripts/graphs/upload-graph.js
```
